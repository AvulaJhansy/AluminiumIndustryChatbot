# AluminumIndustryChatbot

## Problem Definition

The goal of this project is to develop an AI-powered chatbot that provides information about news articles related to the aluminum industry. The chatbot uses embeddings to match user queries with relevant articles and displays the title, description, and link to the user.

## Data Collection and Preprocessing

1. **Data Collection**:
   - **Web Scraping**: Utilized Selenium to scrape news articles from [Metal Industry News - Aluminium](https://news.metal.com/list/industry/aluminium). The articles include titles, descriptions, links, and publication dates.

2. **Data Cleaning and Transformation**:
   - **CSV Processing**: The scraped data was saved in a CSV file. Preprocessing included:
     - Converting date strings to `datetime` format.
     - Parsing time strings to `time` format.
     - Removing unnecessary columns and handling duplicates.

3. **Embedding Generation**:
   - **Text Embeddings**: Used OpenAI's `text-embedding-ada-002` model to generate embeddings for article titles and descriptions.
   - **Saving Embeddings**: Stored the generated embeddings in a JSON file for later use.


## Model Implementation

1. **Embedding Model**:
   - **FAISS Index**: Implemented a FAISS index to facilitate fast similarity searches using the concatenated title and description embeddings.
   - **Embedding Storage**: Stored the FAISS index to enable efficient retrieval of relevant articles based on query embeddings.

2. **Chatbot Functionality**:
   - **Query Processing**: The chatbot uses OpenAI's embedding model to process user queries and find the closest matching article from the FAISS index.
   - **Response Generation**: Provides users with the article's title, description, and link based on the closest match.

## Model Efficiency

- **FAISS Index**: The FAISS index allows for efficient similarity searches with a high performance.
- **Embedding Quality**: The embeddings generated by OpenAI's model provide a robust representation of text, facilitating accurate query matching.

## Deployment using Streamlit

1. **Streamlit App**:
   - **Chatbot Interface**: Developed a Streamlit app with two pages:
     - **Query Page**: Allows users to input queries and receive responses with article details.
     - **Check News Page**: Enables users to select a date and time to view news articles from the CSV file.
   - **API Integration**: Retrieves OpenAI API keys securely and uses them to generate embeddings for user queries.

2. **Running the App**:
   - To start the Streamlit app, run the following command:
     ```bash
     streamlit run streamlit.py
     ```

## Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrates the use of web scraping, text embeddings, and similarity search to build a functional chatbot for querying news articles. The Streamlit deployment provides an intuitive interface for users to interact with the chatbot and access relevant information efficiently.
